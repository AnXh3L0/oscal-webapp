		<title>EU Copyright Reform: Challenges and Risks in the FLOSS Ecosystem</title>
		<description><![CDATA[The current EU Copyright Reform proposal puts pressure on platforms to monitor and filter all description, including uploaded free and open-source software, for copyright infringement (Article 13), proposes a new 20-year license for news snippets (Article 11), and limits who can access datasets -- including open data (Article 3). Any of these would be terrible outcomes. Let's demand better copyright reform!

In this session, we will tackle the following questions:
- What's happening with the EU Copyright Reform?
- How will Articles 11, 13 + 3 affect the Internet experience in Europe?
- How will the proposed reform affect the FLOSS ecosystem in Europe? The rest of the world?
- Why is this happening?
- What is Mozilla doing about it, and what can you do about it?

Note: The EU Copyright Reform restrictions can also be applied to non-EU citizens, therefore everybody regardless of citizenship is encouraged to participate in the session.]]></description>

		<title>The approach to free software and culture at Roma Capitale</title>
		<description>This article is focused on the actions of Roma Capitale to increase its use of Free and Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS), within the framework of Roma Capitaleâs Digital Agenda 2017-2021. The main objective is to break the vendor lock-in, to guarantee more efficiency, sustainability and independence from suppliers in the performance of its duty. Starting from the political level, in 2016 a Resolution for the use of FLOSS was adopted. In a few words, it was decided to be mandatory for this Administration to choose open source solutions whenever possible, taking into consideration the legal and technical constraints. Consequently, during the 2017, the Municipality of Rome took well-orchestrated steps to implement its program about the transformation towards FLOSS: (i) an assessment about Roma Capitaleâs main systems and their impacts on internal and external users, was released; (ii) the open and proprietary components were evaluated; (iii) a migration roadmap to FLOSS was established. At present LibreOffice, Mozilla, Thunderbird, Zimbra have been installed and customized on more than 10000 client workstations and cohabit with proprietary software. A gradual switch off started first by employees that hardly ever use the traditional tools and a community of 100 âFLOSS passionate peopleâ was constituted.</description>

		<title>MOOCs, Open Education and developing countries: something good is in the air?</title>
		<description>Massive Open Online Courses, also known as MOOCs are a relatively new phenomenon in the education sphere, but they are getting the attention of many scholars because of their exponential growth rate and because of the popularity they have gained, especially in developing countries. In order to better understand the MOOCs model in education, we should analyze the contest in which MOOCs were born and where they are developing nowadays. In its core philosophy, education is strictly connected with the concepts of sharing
and openness. The internet age in which we are living and the fast adoption of digital technologies by the vast majority of people living throughout our planet has significantly boosted the degree of openness of education, by bringing into the scene new powerful actors, such as MOOCs.
Furthermore, MOOCs diffusion in developing countries leads to new interesting opportunities and challenging threats. Unfortunately, evidence about MOOCs in developing countries is not really easy to find as the outcome of MOOCs seems to be country specific; in addition, MOOCs are a brand-new topic in the universe of OER, for which further investigation is needed.</description>

		<title>State of open source machine learning</title>
		<description><![CDATA[Machine learning... Probably the most overhyped word in IT nowadays. New frameworks, new tools, thousands of papers each month. Rappers singing on major conferences. It's hard to imagine the machine learning industry without open source projects. What are they? How are they competing? What is waiting for us in the future? And what is called an open research? Let's figure out these questions together.]]></description>

EasyGnuPG is a wrapper script that tries to simplify the process of using GnuPG. In order to simplify things, it is opinionated about the "right" way to use GnuPG.]]></description>

		<title>Executable reverse engineering 101 with radare 2</title>
		<description>Suffering from a lack of good free software tools, reverse engineering on Linux never been a very popular activity among hobbyists. However, more tools exist now, and we will discover how to use Radare2, a GPL set of tools to examine a wide range of binaries.
This session will present the very basics concepts behind assembly and low level languages, and show simple commands and the philosophy behind radare 2. In order to be concrete, a very simple binary will be looked at to illustrate the concepts, tools and practices, and let people be ready to tackle more complex challenges either for fun (such as a security CTF) or for more serious reasons (such as malware and exploit dissecting).
No binaries will be harmed during the presentation.</description>

		<title>Privacy aware city navigation with CityZen</title>
		<description><![CDATA[Navigating our cities using free software community based mobile apps in 'private mode' might sound like an easy task in 2017, but with a little research you will be quickly disappointed. There are related platforms out there, but some of them are lacking good User Experience, others are not community lead or are getting away from the free software freedoms due to their partnerships with companies that do not respect our privacy online. These are only some of the reasons the CityZen app was born in Tirana, as an OSM based Android app that helps us navigate our cities without tracking our location and activities. At the same time the app offers easy mobile optimized OpenStreetMap editing for easy contributions on the go. CityZen aims to be empowered by the community in terms of development and promotion and as a digital wallet for cryptocurrency used to make payments for goods and services from POIs easily through the app. Soon CityZen will apply blockchain as a decentralized process for the management of the cryptocoin based revenue that will be gathered through the app making it one of the few platforms out there used to help you find physical POIs and buy goods without giving away your real identity.]]></description>

		<title>How to improve OSM with official open-data (Tirana use-case)</title>
		<description><![CDATA[Part 1 by Anisa Kuci: OSM Albania member / Open Labs member
In many countries or cities we can find open-data publicly available but it's not always the case, that's why Open Labs contacted the Municipality of Tirana to make them open their data and ... it worked !
Even though each country is different, we think it's usually difficult to connect with officials, especially to promote open-source softwares and open-data, this is how Open Labs community succeeded in both in Tirana.

Part 2 by Jonathan Beliën: OSM Belgium board member / Open Labs remote member
Once we have open-data available (in many formats), how can we make those data available for the many people who do not have a GIS background ?
The idea we had is to create easy-to-use and open-source website and services so anyone can use those data to map in Tirana using their favorite editor (iD, JOSM, ...).

		<title>The Document Foundation - The open, transparent and meritocratic future of free office software</title>
		<description><![CDATA[The Document Foundation is the charitable entity behind LibreOffice, the free office suite. It not only provides a legal framework for the project, but also manages assets and donations to support the further development of the software as well as the community. The organizational setup of TDF is rather unique - by having chosen a German "Stiftung", the community has opted for an entity that is recognized as strong, stable and enduring. Its statutes provide for independence of a single corporate sponsor and at the same time focus on the core values of transparency, openness and meritocracy. In his talk, Florian gives an overview on how the foundation was set up, what goals it has achieved in the last six years of its existence and what plans and visions the community has for their future.]]></description>

		<title>Death by a thousand chats</title>
		<description>Helping developers and users stay sane. Email, Real-time communications services, apps and giant animated billboards are relentlessly seeking to grab our attention, 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. Has it gone too far? A novice motorcyclist needs little training to learn rapid acceleration: to stay alive, however, requires learning how and when to slow down as well. Achieving prosperity and avoiding burn-out in the information age requires a similar level of discipline in our use of technology. As developers, this is even more critical for us as we implement tools for our own communities and our users. In this session, Pocock, an experienced developer in a range of fields including real-time communications and monitoring systems, shines a light on these issues, looks at how we can improve our experience as developers and shows how free software is the most effective way to solve these challenges for our users, society at large.</description>

		<description>Why is that Open Source software provides so much more value to users, yet represents such a small percentage of all software developed? In this interactive session, Sam will explain how economic principles, such as network effects and Economic Value to the Customer, drive proprietary firms to success while challenging Open Source growth. Various economic benefits of Open Source will be explored from the users’ perspective, to illustrate disadvantages which Open Source companies face. Participants will be challenged to find new ways of thinking about established problems to investment in Open Source development.</description>

		<title>LGBT issues on Wikipedia</title>
		<description>I initiated the LGBTI project in Albanian Wikipedia a couple of months ago, when I was scamming through Wikipedia and noticed that there was a strong lack of information regarding topics on LGBT community. I feel close to the same concerns of this marginalized community because I work as a human rights journalist about LGBTI community in Albania. Through this lightining talk I would like to sum up the research I did during this months for the Wiki LGBT project.</description>

		<title>Continuous Immutable Orchestration</title>
		<description><![CDATA[We all know the hype around containers and immutable infrastructure. I have to admit it -- it is something that is quite big. There are notable tools such as Gitlab and Kubernetes/Openshift which can help us achieve immutable infrastructure. Gitlab provides an automated CI and CI pipeline, where an immutable Linux container, complete with its application payload, moves through a series of automated steps, including all the necessary automated tests, perhaps with a final human approval stage and landing in a production environment. Not only does this automated pipeline help to make the work visible (a key tenant in The Phoenix Project), it also enables the development team to achieve greater velocity and avoid the pitfalls of constant manual building and testing of code. With Kubernetes/Openshift as Gitlab’s friend, staging and production deployments remain immutable from the very start of your commit that you have made to your Gitlab project repository. Containers built during the Gitlab pipeline gets deployed as it is to Kubernetes/Openshift. Code compiled and built are turn into artefacts and deploy as it is on to the very same container. Finally, Kubernetes/Openshift orchestrate these containers - managing auto-scale, RBAC and secured communications between containers. Together, these tools helps to ensure that your development environment closely matches your production environment - less worry about the "but it works on my machine" disease we have all had for years and ensures high availability through auto-scaling.]]></description>

		<title>Petting your sideprojects</title>
		<description><![CDATA[A creative mind never sleeps, it cannot be stopped and it doesn't have any boundaries (maybe except of imagining a new color). In the hands of an engineer this can be a powerful double-edged sword. It can both produce the next cool startup that changes the world as well as a bunch of ragequits from your editor. This talk is about how my sideprojects were born, failed, thrived or took control over my work.]]></description>

		<title>Importance of communication in Open Source communities</title>
		<description><![CDATA[Open Source communities are excellent example of most diverse and globally spread work-space. Although, this is a major plus and feels amazing to work in such a diverse culture, but at the same time we need to face the challenge of accurate communication. When we are not at the same place and can't talk face-to-face, expressing the right thing in correct manner becomes more important and we need to take care of several things. Obviously, we are not always using video chats when we are communicating with our fellow community members and lack of those facial expressions make it more complex to deliver the right message. Communication has many attributes to it - right description, ambiguity, accurate by all means (ethically, culturally) and at the end we are conveying what is intended.

We may think communication to be a very basic technique of delivering message, but it gets complicated specially when it is not verbal and not on video chat. You may want to write a good "WOW" but it can be interpreted as a bad "WOW" depending on the receiver's culture/mood and intend.

My paper will highlight certain examples of such communication glitches and also some basic magical rules of good communication.]]></description>

Many non-developers hesitate to contribute but we also need people who file enhancement requests, think about better solutions to the workflow, or make the application visually more attractive. That's what the design team does and this presentation will illustrate what exactly you can do.]]></description>

While building and growing a diverse and inclusive community you're looking for culture to be added, not culture to fit. New people can bring a point of view never seen before and is crucial to be able to include newcomers. The talk will describe the current state of the art of the LibreOffice community, underlining in progress activities and future possible outcomes.]]></description>

		<title>Writing pylint plugins</title>
		<description>Pylint is the most popular Python source code analyzer which looks for programming errors, helps enforcing a coding standard and sniffs for some code smells. It is possible to write plugins to add your own checks, for example coding patterns that you have observed inside your software and are generally a bad practice or rules which you would like to enforce inside of a particular project, e.g. class name and inheritance conventions.</description>

		<title>Machine Learning on Open Source code</title>
		<description><![CDATA[Few people look at open source code as a massive dataset for researchers. Yet we've accumulated hundreds of terabytes of mostly human-generated data on GitHub which can be freely analyzed. Mining Software Repositories academic conference happens every year and presents extremely funny projects on top of open source. GHTorrent, Public Git Archive, TravisTorrent. Coding style transfer, code sentiment analysis, code modeling. This talk makes a very high-level overview of the conference's proceedings and also touches the related research we conduct at source{d}: github.com/src-d/awesome-machine-learning-on-source-code.]]></description>

		<title>Patterns in React</title>
		<description><![CDATA[It's been five years since React's first version was released in 2013. Back then there were little to none code practices, project structures and community rules to be followed. And with the release of React 16 we have a more stable environment some patterns start to evolve as the community it's taking shape. This talk is about some of the most interesting parts of React, Design Patterns, Code structures, Redux best practices and scalability.]]></description>

		<title>How to write pylint plugins</title>
		<description>Pylint is the most popular Python source code analyzer which looks for programming errors, helps enforcing a coding standard and sniffs for some code smells. It is possible to write plugins to add your own checks, for example coding patterns that you have observed inside your software and are generally a bad practice or rules which you would like to enforce inside of a particular project, e.g. class name and inheritance conventions.</description>
